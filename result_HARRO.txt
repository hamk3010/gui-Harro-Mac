(this is VERY important- will give priority to designers who can
include this!) ideas on where the average consumer might
purchase these items to mimic the look. Keep in mind this
person's wallet with your suggestions, things can be expensive

Email: query-9z24@helpareporter.net

Media Outlet: The Times of Northwest Indiana
Deadline: 7:00 PM EST - 30 October

Query:

I'm working on a gift guide that will run in the Times of
Northwest Indiana (a daily newspaper that covers Northwest
Indiana, the south suburbs of Chicago and southwest Michigan).
The guide focuses on "experiences" as gifts for the holidays,
and I'm in need of some ideas! Experiences can include anything
from memberships to physical destinations or online educational
sites, to events such as wine tastings, movies, etc. They could
also be everything you need to host an occasion, such as a wine
tasting, chocolate tasting, camping, etc. If you have any other
ideas, I'm definitely open to them.

Requirements:

With the subject being "experiences," it's best that any events
or memberships to physical locations be regional (within an hour
or so of Chicago). But if it's online, or products you need to
hold an experience, then the company/organization can be located
anywhere.

Media Outlet: CTW Features
Deadline: 12:00 PM CST - 4 November

Query:

Hello. My name is Erik Martin and I am a reporter for Real
Estate Weekly, a nationally syndicated section published weekly
in newspapers across the country (visit
tinyurl.com/ejmctwfeatures for samples). I'm looking to
interview real estate industry professionals, agents, brokers,
lenders, property attorneys, and other real estate pros for the
following topic:

Want a home that will be worth more? Move near public
transportation. A fresh report by the National Association of
Realtors (found at
https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/locations-close-to-public-transit-boost-residential-commercial-real-estate-values) 
shows that Neighborhoods located within a half-mile of public
transit services outperformed those in areas farther from public
transit based on a number of factors. The report explored seven
metropolitan regions - Boston; Hartford; Los Angeles;
Minneapolis-St. Paul; Phoenix; Seattle; and Eugene, OR - that
provide access to heavy rail, light rail, commuter rail, and bus
rapid transit. Residential properties within these areas had
4-24% higher median sale prices between 2012 and 2016, the
report found. Transportation costs in transit-oriented areas are
significantly lower than in other regions, with an average
annual savings of $2,500 to $4,400 for the typical household.
One in four households in close proximity to transit does not
own a vehicle, according to the study. This piece will examine
the study's findings and provide thoughts and recommendations
from experts as to why home shoppers should strongly consider
buying in an area with a good public transportation system.
Below is a list of questions I'm seeking answers to. I can
either conduct a phone or email interview (with the latter,
please email me back full-sentence written responses that I can
use as quotes). My deadline is noon central time, Monday, Nov. 4.

QUESTIONS: 1.	What did you find interesting about the
aforementioned study's findings and why? 2.	Why is it worthwhile
to buy and live near public transit services? What are the pros
and cons, and how can it save money and time in the long run? 3.
For whom does moving near public transit services make the most
sense? Who are not good candidates here and why? 4.	What
detailed tips can you suggest to those who are considering
buying a home near public transit services? How close should
those services be if they plan to use them? What is TOO close?
What minimum transit services should exist (e.g., rail AND
bus?)? 5.	Any other thoughts, tips or suggestions on this topic?
6.	What is your full name, title, company, city/state location

64) Summary: Need sources for story: How to reduce home sellers' fears about uncertainty
Name: Erik Martin

Media Outlet: CTW Features
Deadline: 12:00 PM CST - 4 November

Query:

Hello. My name is Erik Martin and I am a reporter for Real
Estate Weekly, a nationally syndicated section published weekly
in newspapers across the country (visit
tinyurl.com/ejmctwfeatures for samples). I'm looking to
interview real estate industry professionals, agents, brokers,
lenders, property attorneys, and other real estate pros for the
following topic:

A home seller's greatest fear? The unknown: Why uncertainty
causes more stress than showings and repairs. Factors that
traditionally have been harder for sellers to control -- like
uncertainty about timing and price -- cause the most stress, per
the 2019 Zillow Group Consumer Housing Trend Report (details at
http://zillow.mediaroom.com/2019-10-10-Uncertainty-Causes-More-Stress-for-Home-Sellers-than-Repairs-and-Showings). 
95% of home sellers said they consider some aspect of selling a
home stressful, but not knowing if a home will sell within the
desired time frame is the largest source of stress for sellers,
with 56% of them calling it a stressful experience. Meanwhile,
53% of sellers worry about not being able to sell their home for
the price they want, and 52% were stressed about an offer
falling through. One reason timing and financing a home sale can
be stressful is that many home sellers (64%) are buying another
home at the same time. In fact, 51% of home sellers specifically
found it stressful to time the sale of their current home with
the purchase of a new one. 52% of sellers worry about making
improvements to get a home ready to sell. Maintaining a
market-ready home is stressful for 43% of sellers, and 39%
stress about leaving the home for tours and open houses. This
story will highlight the important findings and offer expert
analysis on why sellers are stressed about these matters and how
they can better avoid/manage this stress. Below is a list of
questions I'm seeking answers to. I can either conduct a phone
or email interview (with the latter, please email me back
full-sentence written responses that I can use as quotes). My
deadline is noon central time, Monday, Nov. 4.

QUESTIONS: 1.	What did you find interesting about the
aforementioned study's findings and why? 2.	Why do you believe
uncertainty, especially about price and timing, can cause so
much stress for home sellers? What factors are behind this
phenomenon? 3.	Is it natural/normal for sellers to feel excess
stress due to uncertainty about price and timing, or is this
excessive and unnecessary in any way? Why/why not? 4.	What
detailed tips can you suggest for sellers to reduce/eliminate
their stress when it comes to uncertainty about price and
timing? What can/should they be doing?  5.	Any other thoughts,
tips or suggestions on this topic? 6.	What is your full name,
title, company, city/state location

Query:

Hello. My name is Erik Martin and I am a reporter for Real
Estate Weekly, a nationally syndicated section published weekly
in newspapers across the country (visit
tinyurl.com/ejmctwfeatures for samples). I'm looking to
interview ADU (auxiliary dwelling unit) experts, contractors,
real estate industry professionals, agents, brokers, lenders,
property attorneys, and other real estate pros for the following
topic:

ADU coup: How adding an auxiliary dwelling unit on your property
can be worth it. Also called "backyard bungalows" and "backyard
cottages," auxiliary dwelling units (ADUs) are proving more
popular, as they are able to be used as small rental units or
extra space for boomerang adult kids and aging parents (details
at
https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/21/backyard-bungalows-are-becoming-big-business.html). 
This article will examine why ADUs are popular, where they
can/can't be built, what they can/can't be used for, pros and
cons, costs, and effect on resale value. Below is a list of
questions I'm seeking answers to. I can either conduct a phone
or email interview (with the latter, please email me back
full-sentence written responses that I can use as quotes). My
deadline is noon central time, Monday, Nov. 4.

QUESTIONS: 1.	Please describe what an ADU is, where it is often
built/placed, and what it can be used for. 2.	Do you have any
stats/data you can cite that underscore how popular ADUs have
become and where they're being built? 3.	What are common square
footage size ranges for ADUs, and what are common price ranges
to have one built? 4.	Who make good candidates for an ADU? Who
is a bad candidate? 5.	What are the zoning laws regarding ADUs?
Do many towns not allow them to be built/used? How are they
insured? What are the legal rules and ramifications here? 6.
What should a homeowner consider carefully before choosing to
have an ADU built? What should they avoid? 7.	How/to what extent
can an ADU increase or decrease your property's resale value?
8.	Any other thoughts, tips or suggestions on this topic? 9.
What is your full name, title, company, city/state location

Deadline: 7:00 PM EST - 24 October

Query:

 Hi, My name is Sheldon Chi. I am responsible for coordinating
stories for the 1Mby1M blog [1mby1m.com]]. The Entrepreneur
Journeys (EJ) series is our flagship series and we're looking
for interesting companies with at least $5 million in annual
revenue to feature in lengthy feature stories. We are interested
in interviewing the entrepreneur who can and is willing to
discuss, at length, the nuances of the strategy and process of
company building, spanning topics such as bootstrapping,
financing, positioning, customer acquisition, channels, team
building, etc. To pitch, please provide revenue level, industry
(Our interests: E-Commerce, Cloud Computing, SaaS, Mobile,
Social, Big Data, IoT, FinTech, Digital Media, Gaming,
Healthcare IT, Online Education, etc.) and focus of the story
angle in terms of company-building experience. We use the
revenue level as a qualification criterion for selecting
entrepreneurs to profile. We don't necessarily have to publish
this number in the actual story. The Entrepreneur Journeys
series has already produced 12 books
(http://tinyurl.com/4p4phwy). You can see examples of the series
on our blog (http://tinyurl.com/d8m9mt). This blog is part of
the One Million by One Million global initiative, whose aim is
to help a million entrepreneurs reach $1 million in annual
revenue. We also use the EJ interviews as case studies to teach
other entrepreneurs how to navigate the entrepreneurial waters.
You get publicity, as well as a platform to share your lessons
from the trenches with a large number of aspiring and practicing
entrepreneurs. 1M/1M has syndication relationships with many
venues: HBR, Xconomy, SmallBizTrends, EconomicTimes (India),
Women 2.0, Mashable, Huffington Post, Business Insider,
ReadWriteWeb, and several other sites. Articles we develop
through these interviews often get repackaged for the
syndication partners. The 1Mby1M blog was named by Forbes in the
Top 100 Blog for Entrepreneurs (http://onforb.es/1a6RkOs). The
procedure is to have a one-hour interview by phone or in-person
in Menlo Park, at our office. We will provide the dial-in for
phone interviews, and the address for the in-person interviews.

Requirements:

When you send in your pitch, please be sure to include the
revenue level, as it is the primary criterion we use to select
stories. Unlike other entrepreneurship media, we do not look for
financing as a criterion for determining story worthiness. Also,
if your revenue threshold is below the $5M level currently, you
are welcome to email me, and I will check if your story might
fit in any of our other series. To give you a flavor, here are
some of our other ongoing series: The 1M/1M Deal Radar: Revenue
between $1M and $5M, high growth rate. We typically do email
interviews for this series. Thought Leader Interviews: We also
have Thought Leader Series opportunities in Cloud Computing,
Cyber Security, Mobile and Social, Big Data, Outsourcing, Online
Education, e-commerce, Gaming, Online Fashion, HealthcareIT,
Internet Of Things, etc. These require, however, that the
company has a minimum of $5M in revenue.

out of the "dine alone" stigma and want restaurants to catch up
to the taste, nutrition and ambience demands of single eaters.
--- We need experts to examine the issue of solo dining. Why is
it becoming such a big topic? Why are there so many solo diners?
Is the stigma of dining out alone going away? Why or why not?
Or, how about ordering in and eating alone? How much of a trends
is that, as well? Any tips or programs that cater to solo
diners, eating out or at home? What's your take on the solo
dining issue and why?


Requirements:

Food and dining experts, psychologists, restaurant
workers/owners, actual people who dine out alone or eat at home
alone.

Email: query-9yyp@helpareporter.net

Media Outlet: Cointelegraph
Deadline: 10:00 AM EST - 24 October

Query:

Hey HARO family,

I am currently in the process of writing a new article for
Cointelegraph regarding the recent Seth Shapiro case where he
allegedly lost a huge sum of money because of AT&amp;T's negligence.
Looking to connect with some crypto-legal experts who can
provide me with their insights on the following subjects:

(i) Could you please shed some nuanced light on the recent case
(i.e. key specifics that have not been covered online) where Mr.
Seth Shapiro has alleged that due to AT&amp;T's negligence he has
had to face a total loss of more USD 1.8 Million? 

(ii) As per some of the legal documents available online in
relation to this case, Mr. Shapiro made numerous requests with
AT&amp;Ts support staff to prevent hackers from gaining repeated
entry into his accounts. If this is true, what legal
consequences will the telecom giant most likely face? It would
be ideal if your commentary could be compared with previous
legal precedents of a similar nature (eg. Terpin vs AT&amp;T)

(iii) Mr. Shapiro alleges that a total of four illegal
intrusions into his savings accounts were made -- for which he
repeatedly tried to contact AT&amp;Ts support staff repeatedly --
wouldn't it have been wiser on his part to have invoked the help
of local police agencies to resolve the matter after the first
hack itself? Do these developments place some responsibility on
Mr. Shapiro as well?

(iv) From a legal perspective, does the blame lie on AT&amp;T or
their two employees who allegedly conspired to steal Mr.
Shapiro's digital currency holdings?

(v) Please feel free to add any more pertinent details which I
may have missed out because of my lack of understanding of the
case or general legal expertise.

For your time, we will be more than happy to add your name,
company/profile details in the article. However, we do not link
Twitter, LinkedIn, biz websites since we are an independent
publishing house.

The deadline for the piece is on the 24th of October, 10 am
(Eastern).

Looking forward to hearing from y'all

Best Regards 

Requirements:

Responses should ideally come from crypto/legal experts who are
well aware of the recent developments surrounding the Seth
Shapiro lawsuit.

Media Outlet: FiduciaryNews.com
Deadline: 9:00 PM EST - 22 October

Query:

This article is for those who have just switched jobs. Sometimes
the joy and excitement of starting something new overshadows the
need to make sure you take care of certain tasks. Please email
your answers to the questions prior to deadline. PR folks, no
need to ask if we're interested - we are! - just have your
clients email their answers before the deadline.

1) What the first thing on the mind of someone who has just
started a new job?

2) What personal (i.e., non-work related) tasks do they expect
to need to take care of as they begin working in their new job?
Please list the most pressing first and explain why they're the
most pressing.

3) What are the most important personal tasks new employees are
most likely to overlook in transitioning from their old job to
their new job? For each one, explain why they are important and
why people overlook them.

4) What's the best way for people switching jobs to be reminded
to take care of these overlooked tasks?

5) How can these overlooked tasks best be taken care of?

5a) For example, many people forget about their retirement
savings and leave it in their old company. Why is it better to
consolidate all their old retirement plans into a personal IRA
account rather than continually rolling it over from job to job?

5b) Sometimes a new job may carry with it unexpected expenses
(such as parking, more expensive lunch alternatives, or longer

I need to speak with small/independent retailers about what
they're doing differently this holiday season, and what's behind
the changes. Please note, I said differently -- how has your
strategy changed because of the economy and the fact that
consumers are less confident? If your merchandise is affected by
tariffs and is more expensive, are you adjusting your inventory
or finding ways to absorb the costs, or are you raising your
prices? If you're a retailer with a physical store, what are you
doing differently to be more competitive with online? How are
you reaching out to shoppers to remind them that you offer a
different experience? How are you changing the services that you
offer? Again, I need to know what's different in your strategy
this year. Please briefly respond to any questions that apply to
you. Thank you..

Media Outlet: Rolling out
Deadline: 5:00 PM EST - 25 October

Query:

Hello. My name is Kayla Grant, and I am a student journalist at
rolling out magazine, a national digital news and entertainment
publication targeted to African American millennials. I am
writing an article about rape on Black college campuses, where
people are often reluctant to speak about this difficult topic.
I am hoping to find a rape survivor who would be willing to be
interviewed for my story. Because of rolling out's audience and
the focus of the article, I would like to interview a Black
woman who graduated from an HBCU and is a survivor of rape who
can describe her experience and offer advice to young women (and
men) about what they should/can do to protect themselves and how
to get help (medical, physical, emotional, etc.) and support if
they have been raped. I have statistics, but numbers alone won't
tell the story. I need a survivor who can really help put a face
on this issue and make it personal for our readers. I will be
working closely with my editor -- a 25-year veteran journalist
-- to ensure that the final article is accurate and sensitively
handled given the difficult nature of the topic. I am also
seeking experts either at rape crisis centers, nonprofits
dealing with sexual violence, sex educators or others who can
speak to the college-age students and millennials. Any help will
be greatly appreciated. I can be reached via email address at
ksgrant8@gmail.com. Thank you in advance for your time and
consideration.

Name: Addison Nugent
Category: Education 

Email: query-9yz4@helpareporter.net

Media Outlet: OZY
Deadline: 7:00 PM EST - 23 October

Query:

Hello,   I am writing an article on shared trauma in Japan post
the 2011 Tsunami. 

Shortly after the devastation of the 2011 tsunami taxis drivers
in the coastal town of Ishinomaki, where 6,000 people were swept
away by the waves, reportedly started picking up ghosts. While
doing research for her thesis, Ph.D. student Yuka Kudo headed to
the devastated town to see if the locals were experiencing any
paranormal activity. Each week she rode in cabs asking "Did you
have any unusual experiences after the disaster?" The majority
of the 100 cabbies ignored her but seven told eerily similar
stories of spectral passengers trying to find their way home.
One driver said he picked up a woman in a coat in early summer,
several months after the tsunami. "Please go to the Minamihama
(district)," the woman said. He told her the area was empty --
it had been devastated by the tsunami. Then, she asked a very
strange question in a shaking voice: "Have I died?" Another
driver spoke of a man possibly in his 20s who climbed into his
cab. He spied the stranger through the rear-view mirror,
pointing forward. He asked the man for his destination and the
ghost passenger said "Hiyoriyama," which means mountain. When
they arrived, the man vanished. Could these ghostly passengers
have been illusions brought on by collective grief? Perhaps, but
the drivers' meters tell a different story: some of the seven
who spoke to Yuka had recorded the experience in their logs, and
one had a report that proved his unpaid fare. 

I am looking for a quote on how these ghosts could be a
manifestation of shared psychological trauma after the
devastation of the Tsunami.

Deadline: 12:00 PM CST - 4 November

Query:

Hello. My name is Erik Martin and I am a reporter for HomeStyle,
a nationally syndicated home improvement/design section
published weekly in newspapers across the country (visit
https://tinyurl.com/ejmctwfeatures for samples). I'm looking to
interview home improvement professionals, remodelers, industry
experts, real estate agents, property attorneys, and homeowners
for the following story:

What to expect when you're expecting to remodel. A new report by
Chase and HGTV (details at
https://media.chase.com/media-assets/infographics/sweat-equity)
attempted to learn why homeowners want to improve, if they plan
to take a DIY-approach, and how much they expect to pay for it.
Among the findings: 8 in 10 homeowners expect their home will
need work; half plan to do-it-themselves vs. 30% who plan to
hire a contractor; 50% expect improvements to be physically
challenging work; the top three reasons to make home
improvements are to add value, create a comfortable space for
family and for hosting, and feed their hobby of DIY/home
improvement; and 58% projected spending up to $10,000 on a
project, 21% foresee projects of $10,000 to $25,000, and 21%
aimed high, spending at least $25,000. This article will share
the important findings and provide analysis and suggestions from
experts about what homeowners should expect before and during a
project, especially if they plan to do it themselves. Below is a
list of questions I'm seeking answers to. I can either conduct a
phone or email interview (with the latter, please email me back
full-sentence written responses that I can use as quotes). My
deadline is noon central time, Monday, Nov. 4.

QUESTIONS: 1.	Which of the aforementioned study's findings did
you find surprising and why? 2.	Why is it important to know what
to expect (when it comes to cost, time duration, surprises,
outcomes, etc.) before embarking on a home improvement project?
3.	How can/should homeowners create more realistic expectations
for a project before they commit to it? What should they be
doing/thinking about here to avoid regrets and surprises later
and be more satisfied with the outcomes? Please provide detailed
tips. 4.	How can/should a homeowner's expectations be expected
to change if they plan on doing the work themselves vs. hiring a
pro? 5.	Any other thoughts, tips or suggestions on this topic?
6.	What is your full name, title, company, city/state location,
and email address?

here? 2.	What are the best ways to shovel or snowblow snow and
ice? When should this be done, using what kinds of equipment,
and where should they focus/avoid? What are the best techniques

needed, take breaks to avoid strain, don't do these things with
your snowblower, etc.)? 3.	Where can/should ice melt/road salt
be used on your property and when? How much is enough? How many
bags should you stock up on for the season? Where can it be

Deadline: 12:00 PM CST - 4 November

Query:

Hello. My name is Erik Martin and I am a reporter for Real
Estate Weekly, a nationally syndicated section published weekly
in newspapers across the country (visit
tinyurl.com/ejmctwfeatures for samples). I'm looking to
interview real estate industry professionals, agents, brokers,
lenders, property attorneys, and other real estate pros for the
following topic:

Spread your snowbird wings: What to consider before buying a
second home in a warmer climate. Many people dream of
vacationing or living in a second home in a warmer climate
during the colder months. This article will provide insights and
tips on who makes a good candidate for this strategy, what to
consider carefully, where to look, what to avoid, etc. Below is
a list of questions I'm seeking answers to. I can either conduct
a phone or email interview (with the latter, please email me
back full-sentence written responses that I can use as quotes).
My deadline is noon central time, Monday, Nov. 4.

QUESTIONS: 1.	Why do so many homeowners choose to become
"snowbirds" and live in a second/vacation home location in a
warmer climate during colder months? What's behind this trend?
2.	Do you have any recent stats/data you can cite that indicates
how many/what % of homeowners are snowbirds? 3.	Who makes a good
candidate for a snowbird and why? Who's a bad candidate and why?
4.	What are the pros and cons of being a snowbird owner of two
homes? 5.	What are the best locations, overall/in general, for
snowbirds to purchase a second home in and why? 6.	What should
people consider carefully before committing to purchase/own a
second home in a warmer climate they may only use a few months
of the year? 7.	How can/should snowbird owners of a second home
monetize that property to offset their costs (e.g., rent it out
at other times of the year)? What should their realistic
expectations be if they choose this route--can it be profitable?
What is required when renting out a second home (e.g., hire a
maintenance/management company, prepare to pay taxes, etc.)? 8.
Is there a better alternative to being a snowbird owner of a
second home (e.g., use that money to travel and rent during the
winter months instead)? 9.	Any other thoughts, tips or
suggestions on this topic? 10.	What is your full name, title,
company, city/state location

Media Outlet: The Manual
Deadline: 12:00 PM EST - 28 October

Query:

For this story, I'm looking for chefs to weigh in on the notion
of "chef's choice" orders at restaurants. These days, lots of
restaurants feature tasting menus that are, by nature, up to the
chef's discretion. However, even at restaurants with
clearly-defined menus, some diners will ask their server to
"tell the chef to send out whatever he/she wants". This can
offer the chef an opportunity for creativity..but is it
annoying, when the chef takes the time to create a menu, to have
diners ask him/her to "go rogue"?

If you'd like to participate, send your name, location, the
restaurant/company where you work and your position, and 1-3
sentences explaining your thoughts on "chef's choice" ordering
at non-tasting-menu restaurants.

5) Summary: What Will be the Impact of CCPA on Employee and 3rd Party Contractors?
Name: Derek Handova
Category: Business and Finance 

Email: query-9ywy@helpareporter.net

Media Outlet: Security Boulevard
Deadline: 11:00 PM PST - 24 October

Query:

The USA's answer to GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act
(CCPA), enacted in 2018, will create new consumer rights
relating to the access to, deletion of, and sharing of personal
information that is collected by businesses. It also requires
California's Attorney General to solicit broad public
participation and adopt regulations to further the CCPA's
purposes. The proposed regulations will establish procedures to
facilitate consumers' new rights under the CCPA and provide
guidance to businesses for how to comply. 

And while the CCPA directly targets the privacy rights of
consumers, what are its implications for a company's employees
and third-party contractors? Because the CCPA applies to
"consumers" and defines "consumers" so widely it would cover
employees and job applicants, which are not ordinarily
understood to be consumers. Recognizing this problem, the
legislature introduced Assembly Bill 25 to exempt employers for
one year from abiding by the CCPA with respect to information
collected "by a business in the course of the natural person
acting as a job applicant to, an employee of, director of,
officer of, medical staff member of, or contractor of that
business."

This article will look at the CCPA's impact on employees as to
the above and how it involves how:

1. CCPA grants California residents comprehensive privacy rights

2. Businesses don't have to be located in California to be
impacted

3. Citizens will be allowed "private right of action" under CCPA
for a security breach

4. CCPA defines terms differently from previous privacy
legislation

5. CCPA will be enforced is still unclear

6. Technological solutions like secure browsers, runtime
application self-protection, virtualized desktop-as-a-service,
and others fit into a compliance program

7. New York state consumer privacy rights complement, overlap,
and/or contradict CCPA

 Our Thought Leaders in Online Education (TLOE) blog is a
follow-up to our highly successful Thought Leaders series (TLBD,
TLCC, TLMS). In TLOE, we interview thought leaders in the
educational technology/online education sectors -- whether they
are entrepreneurs building great companies, product/user
experience designers building great products, deans at colleges
and universities, or executives at large companies with unique
perspectives on how the education industry is evolving. We
discuss trends, disruptions, entrepreneurial opportunities,
monetization models, challenges, socio-cultural impact and much
more in a seven-part series. This blog is part of the One
Million by One Million global initiative, whose aim is to help a
million entrepreneurs reach $1 million in annual revenue. 1M/1M
has syndication relationships with many venues: HBR, Xconomy,
SmallBizTrends, EconomicTimes (India), Women 2.0, Mashable,
Huffington Post, Business Insider, ReadWriteWeb, and several
other sites. Articles we develop through these interviews often
get repackaged for the syndication partners. The 1Mby1M blog was
named by Forbes in the Top 100 Blog for Entrepreneurs
(http://onforb.es/1a6RkOs) and among the top 100 influencers on
the topic of cloud computing. Sramana Mitra was also named as
one of the top 10 LinkedIn influencers of 2015
(https://goo.gl/AN9TjS). Indicate in your pitch the revenue
level, as we use this as a qualification criterion for selecting
entrepreneurs to profile. We don't necessarily have to publish
this number in the actual story. Our audience is extremely
sophisticated, so the conversation needs to be equally

Hello. My name is Erik Martin and I am a reporter for HomeStyle,
a nationally syndicated home improvement/design section
published weekly in newspapers across the country (visit
https://tinyurl.com/ejmctwfeatures for samples). I'm looking to
interview kitchen designers, remodelers, contractors, real
estate agents, and homeowners for the following story:

The joy of remodeling: The top home improvement projects that
bring the highest happiness. A new study by the National
Association of Realtors (details at
https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/home-improvement-projects-are-worth-cost-and-time-says-realtor-survey-300930700.html) 
finds that, after completing a remodeling project, 74% of owners
have a greater desire to be in their home, 65% say they
experience increased enjoyment, and 77% feel a major sense of
accomplishment, 58% report a feeling of happiness when they see
their completed projects, while 38% say they have a feeling of
satisfaction. The top 5 projects that earned the highest "joy
scores" (with "10" being highest score) are kitchen renovation
(score: 10); closet renovation (10); full interior paint job
(9.8); new fiberglass front door (9.7); and new vinyl windows
(9.6). This article will cover the major study results and
include commentary and tips from professionals as to why these
and other projects can yield the most satisfaction/joy. Below is
a list of questions I'm seeking answers to. I can either conduct
a phone or email interview (with the latter, please email me
back full-sentence written responses that I can use as quotes).
My deadline is noon central time, Monday, Nov. 4, 2019.

QUESTIONS: 1.	Which of the aforementioned study's findings did
you find surprising and why? 2.	Why is it, do you believe, that
some home improvement/remodeling projects bring more joy to
homeowners than others? What can affect happiness/satisfaction
with a particular project? 3.	Why do you believe the top 5
projects (listed above) earn the highest "Joy Scores"? Please
provide your opinion on each of the five. 4.	How important is it
that a home improvement project make the homeowner happy/joyful?
Is this measure more important than getting a good return on
your investment or getting good functionality from the finished
product? Why/why not?  5.	What tips can you suggest to ensure
homeowners feel happier/more joyful about a home improvement
project? 6.	Any other thoughts, tips or suggestions on this
topic? 7.	What is your full name, title, company, city/state
location, and email address?

29) Summary: Need sources for story: 2020 color of the year paint selections--which are best
Name: Erik Martin
Category: General

Email: query-9yxg@helpareporter.net

Media Outlet: CTW Features
Deadline: 12:00 PM CST - 4 November

Query:

Hello. My name is Erik Martin and I am a reporter for HomeStyle,
a nationally syndicated home improvement/design section
published weekly in newspapers across the country (visit
https://tinyurl.com/ejmctwfeatures for samples). I'm looking to
interview professional painters, interior designers, paint
manufacturers/vendors, real estate agents, and homeowners for
the following story:

Color me ready for 2020: Many paint brands have announced their
2020 "color of the year" (COTY) choices. This is the traditional
time of the year when hot new paint hues are introduced as
official COTY selections (for a roundup, visit
https://www.bhg.com/news/2020-color-of-the-year/). This story
will share that news for each major paint brand and include
insights and tips from paint/design experts on which colors they
recommend and in which rooms/applications. Below is a list of
questions I'm seeking answers to. I can either conduct a phone
or email interview (with the latter, please email me back
full-sentence written responses that I can use as quotes). My
deadline is noon central time, Monday, Nov. 4.

QUESTIONS: 1. Why do major paint brands release "color of the
year" colors around this time every year? What's the goal here,
and how can homeowners benefit? 2. How is a homeowner supposed
to pick from among these "color of the year" choices, especially
if some of them clash with other color of the year choices? In
other words, they may not follow a particular trend (e.g., earth
tones). Isn't this confusing to consumers? 3. Why should
consumers take "color of the year" picks seriously, especially
if they're thinking about repainting one or more rooms? 4. What
"color of the year" choices do you particularly like (from among
the ones recently announced by Benjamin Moore, Sherwin Williams,
etc.) and why? Please cite the exact brand/color, indicate which
room(s) this may work best in, and suggest a complementary color
(from the same brand/color family). 5. What should homeowners
consider carefully before picking/buying any paint color (e.g.,
harmonizing with other elements in the room, the sheen, how
quickly it can become outdated, etc.)? 6. Any other thoughts,
tips or suggestions on this topic? 7. What is your full name,
title, company, city/state location, and email address?

Pricey DIY regrets: Avoid these costly home improvement
mistakes. A new study from Clovered (details at

reveals which home improvement mistakes cost the most. They
surveyed 1,000 homeowners about their experiences with DIY
projects, which ones aren't worth it, and how much it costs when
it is done wrong. Among the findings: Installing a kitchen sink
can cost you $200 to DIY, while some professional instillations
only cost $99; over 114,000 ER visits for fractured bones are
caused by home improvement projects involving a ladder; the
median amount spent fixing DIY mistakes is $137.50. This piece
will cover the key findings from the study and include
commentary and recommendations from experts as to what to avoid
when tackling a DIY home improvement project. Below is a list of

before embarking on an improvement project in order to avoid
mistakes/regrets? 4.	What detailed tips can you suggest to
homeowners to prevent these kinds of costly mistakes/regrets?
What can/should they be doing or avoiding? 5.	When is it best to
hire a pro for the job vs. doing it yourself and why? What kinds
of projects? 6.	Any other thoughts, tips or suggestions on this
topic? 7.	What is your full name, title, company, city/state

Media Outlet: One Million by One Million
Deadline: 7:00 PM EST - 23 October

Query:

Our Thought Leaders in Mobile and Social (TLMS) blog is a
follow-up to our highly successful Thought Leaders in Cloud
Computing series (http://tinyurl.com/lt5vnta). In TLMS, we
interview thought leaders in the mobile and social sectors,
whether they are entrepreneurs building great companies,
product/user experience designers building great products, or
executives at large companies with unique perspectives on how
the mobile and social industries are evolving. We discuss
trends, disruptions, entrepreneurial opportunities, monetization
models, challenges, socio-cultural impact and much more in a
seven-part series. This blog is part of the One Million by One
Million global initiative, whose aim is to help a million
entrepreneurs reach $1 million in annual revenue
(http://1mby1m.com). 1M/1M has syndication relationships with
many venues: HBR, Xconomy, SmallBizTrends, EconomicTimes
(India), Women 2.0, Mashable, Huffington Post, Business Insider,
ReadWriteWeb, and several other sites. Articles we develop
through these interviews often get repackaged for the
syndication partners. The 1Mby1M blog was named by Forbes in the
Top 100 Blog for Entrepreneurs (http://onforb.es/1a6RkOs) and
among the top 100 influencers on the topic of cloud computing.
Please indicate in your pitch the revenue level, as we use this
as a qualification criterion for selecting entrepreneurs to
profile. We do not necessarily have to publish this number in
the actual story. Please also provide the story angle, talking
points, etc., so we can gauge what is the thought leadership
point of view we will be highlighting. Our audience is extremely
sophisticated, so the conversation needs to be equally
interesting.
