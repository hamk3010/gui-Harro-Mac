Name: Erik Martin

Email: query-9yxl@helpareporter.net

Media Outlet: HomeStyle
Deadline: 12:00 PM CST - 4 November

Query:

Hello. My name is Erik Martin and I am a reporter for HomeStyle,
a nationally syndicated home improvement/design section
published weekly in newspapers across the country (visit
https://tinyurl.com/ejmctwfeatures for samples). I'm looking to
interview home improvement professionals, remodelers, industry
experts, real estate agents, property attorneys, and homeowners
for the following story:

What to expect when you're expecting to remodel. A new report by
Chase and HGTV (details at
https://media.chase.com/media-assets/infographics/sweat-equity)
attempted to learn why homeowners want to improve, if they plan
to take a DIY-approach, and how much they expect to pay for it.
Among the findings: 8 in 10 homeowners expect their home will
need work; half plan to do-it-themselves vs. 30% who plan to
hire a contractor; 50% expect improvements to be physically
challenging work; the top three reasons to make home
improvements are to add value, create a comfortable space for
family and for hosting, and feed their hobby of DIY/home
improvement; and 58% projected spending up to $10,000 on a
project, 21% foresee projects of $10,000 to $25,000, and 21%
aimed high, spending at least $25,000. This article will share
the important findings and provide analysis and suggestions from
experts about what homeowners should expect before and during a
project, especially if they plan to do it themselves. Below is a
list of questions I'm seeking answers to. I can either conduct a
phone or email interview (with the latter, please email me back
full-sentence written responses that I can use as quotes). My
deadline is noon central time, Monday, Nov. 4.

QUESTIONS: 1.	Which of the aforementioned study's findings did
you find surprising and why? 2.	Why is it important to know what
to expect (when it comes to cost, time duration, surprises,
outcomes, etc.) before embarking on a home improvement project?
3.	How can/should homeowners create more realistic expectations
for a project before they commit to it? What should they be
doing/thinking about here to avoid regrets and surprises later
and be more satisfied with the outcomes? Please provide detailed
tips. 4.	How can/should a homeowner's expectations be expected
to change if they plan on doing the work themselves vs. hiring a
pro? 5.	Any other thoughts, tips or suggestions on this topic?
6.	What is your full name, title, company, city/state location,
and email address?

20) Summary: Looing for a crypto-legal experts to comment on the Seth Shapiro Case
Name: Shiraz jagati
Category: Business and Finance 

Email: query-9yyp@helpareporter.net

Media Outlet: Cointelegraph
Deadline: 10:00 AM EST - 24 October

Query:

Hey HARO family,

I am currently in the process of writing a new article for
Cointelegraph regarding the recent Seth Shapiro case where he
allegedly lost a huge sum of money because of AT&amp;T's negligence.
Looking to connect with some crypto-legal experts who can
provide me with their insights on the following subjects:

(i) Could you please shed some nuanced light on the recent case
(i.e. key specifics that have not been covered online) where Mr.
Seth Shapiro has alleged that due to AT&amp;T's negligence he has
had to face a total loss of more USD 1.8 Million? 

(ii) As per some of the legal documents available online in
relation to this case, Mr. Shapiro made numerous requests with
AT&amp;Ts support staff to prevent hackers from gaining repeated
entry into his accounts. If this is true, what legal
consequences will the telecom giant most likely face? It would
be ideal if your commentary could be compared with previous
legal precedents of a similar nature (eg. Terpin vs AT&amp;T)

(iii) Mr. Shapiro alleges that a total of four illegal
intrusions into his savings accounts were made -- for which he
repeatedly tried to contact AT&amp;Ts support staff repeatedly --
wouldn't it have been wiser on his part to have invoked the help
of local police agencies to resolve the matter after the first
hack itself? Do these developments place some responsibility on
Mr. Shapiro as well?

(iv) From a legal perspective, does the blame lie on AT&amp;T or
their two employees who allegedly conspired to steal Mr.
Shapiro's digital currency holdings?

(v) Please feel free to add any more pertinent details which I
may have missed out because of my lack of understanding of the
case or general legal expertise.

For your time, we will be more than happy to add your name,
company/profile details in the article. However, we do not link
Twitter, LinkedIn, biz websites since we are an independent
publishing house.

The deadline for the piece is on the 24th of October, 10 am
(Eastern).

Looking forward to hearing from y'all

Best Regards 

Requirements:

Responses should ideally come from crypto/legal experts who are
well aware of the recent developments surrounding the Seth
Shapiro lawsuit.

Deadline: 7:00 PM EST - 24 October

Query:

Are you a licensed therapist willing to share the ways you deal
with your own family issues?

For this piece, I'd love to learn a bit about the workings of
your family relationships and your personal approach to dealing
with the drama that comes with being around family for extended
periods. If you're open to sharing specifics (maybe there's a
racist in-law or a strained relationship between two cousins)
that would be amazing. If not, then hypotheticals would work too.

I'm hoping these tips will help others dealing with family
issues this holiday season and beyond.

Name: Erik Martin
Category: General

Email: query-9yxg@helpareporter.net

Media Outlet: CTW Features
Deadline: 12:00 PM CST - 4 November

Query:

Hello. My name is Erik Martin and I am a reporter for HomeStyle,
a nationally syndicated home improvement/design section
published weekly in newspapers across the country (visit
https://tinyurl.com/ejmctwfeatures for samples). I'm looking to
interview professional painters, interior designers, paint
manufacturers/vendors, real estate agents, and homeowners for
the following story:

Color me ready for 2020: Many paint brands have announced their
2020 "color of the year" (COTY) choices. This is the traditional
time of the year when hot new paint hues are introduced as
official COTY selections (for a roundup, visit
https://www.bhg.com/news/2020-color-of-the-year/). This story
will share that news for each major paint brand and include
insights and tips from paint/design experts on which colors they
recommend and in which rooms/applications. Below is a list of
questions I'm seeking answers to. I can either conduct a phone
or email interview (with the latter, please email me back
full-sentence written responses that I can use as quotes). My
deadline is noon central time, Monday, Nov. 4.

QUESTIONS: 1. Why do major paint brands release "color of the
year" colors around this time every year? What's the goal here,
and how can homeowners benefit? 2. How is a homeowner supposed
to pick from among these "color of the year" choices, especially
if some of them clash with other color of the year choices? In
other words, they may not follow a particular trend (e.g., earth
tones). Isn't this confusing to consumers? 3. Why should
consumers take "color of the year" picks seriously, especially
if they're thinking about repainting one or more rooms? 4. What
"color of the year" choices do you particularly like (from among
the ones recently announced by Benjamin Moore, Sherwin Williams,
etc.) and why? Please cite the exact brand/color, indicate which
room(s) this may work best in, and suggest a complementary color
(from the same brand/color family). 5. What should homeowners
consider carefully before picking/buying any paint color (e.g.,
harmonizing with other elements in the room, the sheen, how
quickly it can become outdated, etc.)? 6. Any other thoughts,
tips or suggestions on this topic? 7. What is your full name,
title, company, city/state location, and email address?
